Current efforts to restore peatlands at a large scale therefore require low cost and high throughput techniques to monitor the evolution of organic matter. In this study, we assessed the merits of using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra to predict the organic matter composition in peat samples at various stages of peatland regeneration from five European countries. Using predictive partial least squares (PLS) analyses, we were able to reconstruct peat C:N ratio and carbohydrate signatures with reasonable accuracy, but not the micromorphological composition of vegetation remains. Despite utilising different size fractions, both carbohydrate (o200 mm fraction) and FTIR (bulk soil) analyses report on the composition of plant cell wall constituents in the peat and therefore essentially reveal the composition of the parent vegetational material. The accuracy of the FTIR-based PLS models for C:N ratios and carbohydrate signatures was adequate to allow for their use as initial screening tools in the evaluation of the present and future organic matter composition of peat during monitoring of restoration efforts.},

Under future warmer conditions predicted for higher latitudes, however, that balance may shift towards higher rates of heterotrophic respiration leading to the release of previously stored C as CO               2               and CH               4               . The Spruce and Peatlands Response Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment is designed to test the response of peatlands to climate forcing using a series of warmed enclosures in combination with peat below-ground heating from 0 to +9\textdegree C above ambient conditions. This experimental design allowed a test of chemical changes occurring within peatland soils following five years of warming. We analyzed samples in the uppermost 2m of peat using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) to quantify the relative abundance of carbohydrate and aromatic compounds in the peat. The peat soils were subjected to deep peat heating (DPH) beginning in June of 2014 followed by whole ecosystem warming (WEW) in August of 2015. We found that the relative amounts of labile and recalcitrant chemical compound groups across the full peat depth interval did not significantly change after five years of exposure to warming. This appears the case even though previous studies have shown that net C losses and loss of bulk peat mass to be instability over that time period. Results suggest that the current store of carbon in peatlands are largely compositionally stable leading to no changes the in the ratio of chemical moieties on the initial four-year timescale of this experiment.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Peat humification or decomposition is a frequently used proxy to extract past time changes in hydrology and climate from peat bogs. During the past century several methods to determine changes in peat decomposition have been introduced. Most of these methods are operationally defined only and the chemical changes underlying the decomposition process are often poorly understood and lack validation. Owing to the chemically undefined nature of many humification analyses the comparison of results obtained by different methods is difficult. In this study we compared changes in peat decomposition proxies in cores of two peat bogs (K\"onigsmoor, KK; Kleines Rotes Bruch, KRB) from the Harz Mountains (Germany) using C / N ratios, Fourier transform infrared spectra absorption (FTIR) intensities, Rock Eva\textregistered{} oxygen and hydrogen indices, {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N isotopic signatures and UV-absorption (UV-ABS) of NaOH peat extracts. In order to explain parallels and discrepancies between these methods, one of the cores was additionally analysed by pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (pyrolysis-GC-MS). Pyrolysis-GC-MS data provide detailed information on a molecular level, which allows differentiation of both changes attributed to decomposition processes and changes in vegetation. Principal component analysis was used to identify and separate the effects of changes in vegetation pattern and decomposition processes because both may occur simultaneously upon changes in bog hydrology. Records of decomposition proxies show similar historical development at both sites, indicating external forcing such as climate as controlling the process. All decomposition proxies except UV-ABS and {$\delta$}15N isotopes show similar patterns in their records and reflect to different extents signals of decomposition. The molecular composition of the KK core reveals that these changes are mainly attributed to decomposition processes and to a lesser extent to changes in vegetation. Changes in the molecular composition indicate that peat decomposition in the KK bog is mainly characterized by preferential decomposition of phenols and polysaccharides and relative enrichment of aliphatics during drier periods. Enrichment of lignin and other aromatics during decomposition was also observed but showed less variation than polysaccharides or aliphatics, and presumably reflects changes in vegetation associated with changes in hydrology of the bogs. Significant correlations with polysaccharide and aliphatic pyrolysis products were found for C / N ratios, FTIR-band intensities and for hydrogen index values, supporting that these decomposition indices provide reasonable information. Correlations of polysaccharide and aliphatic pyrolysis products with oxygen index values and {$\delta$}13C was weaker, assumingly indicating carboxylation of the peat during drier periods and enrichment of isotopically lighter peat components during decomposition, respectively. FTIR, C / N ratio, pyrolysis-GC-MS analyses and Rock Eval hydrogen indices appear to reflect mass loss and related changes in the molecular peat composition during mineralization best. Pyrolysis-GC-MS allows disentangling the decomposition processes and vegetation changes. UV-ABS measurements of alkaline peat extracts show only weak correlation with other decomposition proxies and pyrolysis results as they mainly reflect the formation of humic acids through humification and to a lesser extent mass loss during mineralization.},

Ombrotrophic bogs in southern Patagonia have been examined with regard to paleoclimatic and geochemical research questions but knowledge about organic matter decomposition in these bogs is limited. Therefore, we examined peat humification with depth by Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) measurements of solid peat, C/N ratio, and {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N isotope measurements in three bog sites. Peat decomposition generally increased with depth but distinct small scale variation occurred, reflecting fluctuations in factors controlling decomposition. C/N ratios varied mostly between 40 and 120 and were significantly correlated (R2 {$>$} 0.55, p {$<$} 0.01) with FTIR-derived humification indices. The degree of decomposition was lowest at a site presently dominated by Sphagnum mosses. The peat was most strongly decomposed at the driest site, where currently peat-forming vegetation produced less refractory organic material, possibly due to fertilizing effects of high sea spray deposition. Decomposition of peat was also advanced near ash layers, suggesting a stimulation of decomposition by ash deposition. Values of {$\delta$}13C were 26.5 {$\pm$} 2\textperthousand{} in the peat and partly related to decomposition indices, while {$\delta$}15N in the peat varied around zero and did not consistently relate to any decomposition index. Concentrations of DOM partly related to C/N ratios, partly to FTIR derived indices. They were not conclusively linked to the decomposition degree of the peat. DOM was enriched in 13C and in 15N relative to the solid phase probably due to multiple microbial modifications and recycling of N in these N-poor environments. In summary, the depth profiles of C/N ratios, {$\delta$}13C values, and FTIR spectra seemed to reflect changes in environmental conditions affecting decomposition, such as bog wetness, but were dominated by site specific factors, and are further influenced by ash deposition and possibly by sea spray input.},

Solid peat residues were freeze-dried, milled very finely and analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Pore waters expressed from the peat slices were collected, filtered (0.2 mm membrane filters) and analyzed using fluorescence emission, excitation and synchronous-scan spectroscopy, in addition to pH. Taken together, the physical properties of the core and the ESR measurements of solid peats appear to record the variation in humification of refractory organic matter (peat). The fluorescence and FT-IR data, on the other hand, appear to characterize the extent of recent decomposition of labile organic matter. In fact, these data indicate the presence of two distinct zones in the bog: (i) the acrotelm, or zone of active decay, which may be oxygenated, depending on the season and the depth to the water table, and (ii) the catotelm which is always anoxic, and where organic matter decomposition rates are negligible.},

Most peatlands are distributed in mid-high latitude regions and are even in permafrost regions, are sensitive to climate change and are disturbed by wildfire. Although several studies have focused on the impact of historical climate change and regional human activities on the C. accumulation process in these peatlands, the impact of these factors on the stability of the C. pool remains poorly understood. Here, based on the 210Pb age-depth model, we investigated the historical variations of C. stability during the last 150 years for five typical peatlands in the northern Great Khingan Mountains (Northeast China), an area located in a permafrost region that is sensitive to climate change and to wildfires, which have clearly increased due to regional human activities. The results showed that low C. accumulation rates (CARs) and weakly C. stability in studied peatlands before 1900. While, the increasing anthropogenic wildfire frequency and the residual products (e.g. pyrogenic carbon) increased the CARs and C. stability in peatlands from 1900 to 1980. The mean July temperature is the most important climate factor for peatlands C. stability. After 1980, due to the low wildfire frequencies influenced by human policies, increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation not only increased the CARs but also markedly increased the C. stability of the peatlands C. pool in the northern Great Khingan Mountains, especially after 2000. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, methods to characterize the composition of mixtures of lignocellulosic materials such as municipal solid waste (MSW) according to different taxonomic classes of plants are useful. The copper oxide (CuO) oxidation products of lignin provide molecular markers that allow for characterization of the initial plants. The objective of this study was to determine if the chemical composition of the monomers present after CuO oxidation can be used to infer information on the content of woody angiosperms (hardwood\textemdash HW), non-woody angiosperms (leaves and grasses\textemdash LG), woody gymnosperms (softwood\textemdash SW), and non-woody gymnosperms (needles\textemdash GN). Results showed that the composition of HW and SW in synthetic mixtures can be estimated from CuO oxidation products of lignin within an error of \AE 60\% of the expected values. The high uncertainty in the estimate of composition in synthetic mixtures can be attributed to the fact that the components selected for the synthetic mixtures had different CuO oxidation products compared to the average which was used in developing the mixing model. Application of the mixing model to estimate the composition of samples from a Kentucky (KY) landfill showed that the majority of the samples are from HW and SW with little to no non-woody tissues (LG, GN). However, the mixing model is not sufficiently precise to infer more detailed information on MSW composition.

Historical land cover changes have resulted globally in SOC release into the atmosphere. This human induced SOC decrease was nearly balanced by the net SOC increase due to higher CO2 and rainfall. Mechanization of agriculture after the 1950s has accelerated SOC losses in croplands, whereas development of carbon-sequestering practices over the past decades may have limited SOC loss from arable soils.

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the performance of Bayesian models commonly used for genomic selection to predict ``difficult-to-predict'' dairy traits, such as milk fatty acid (FA) expressed as percentage of total fatty acids, and technological properties, such as fresh cheese yield and protein recovery, using Fouriertransform infrared (FTIR) spectral data. Our main hypothesis was that Bayesian models that can estimate shrinkage and perform variable selection may improve our ability to predict FA traits and technological traits above and beyond what can be achieved using the current calibration models (e.g., partial least squares, PLS). To this end, we assessed a series of Bayesian methods and compared their prediction performance with that of PLS. The comparison between models was done using the same sets of data (i.e., same samples, same variability, same spectral treatment) for each trait. Data consisted of 1,264 individual milk samples collected from Brown Swiss cows for which gas chromatographic FA composition, milk coagulation properties, and cheese-yield traits were available. For each sample, 2 spectra in the infrared region from 5,011 to 925 cm-1 were available and averaged before data analysis. Three Bayesian models: Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes RR), Bayes A, and Bayes B, and 2 reference models: PLS and modified PLS (MPLS) procedures, were used to calibrate equations for each of the traits. The Bayesian models used were implemented in the R package BGLR (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ BGLR/index.html), whereas the PLS and MPLS were those implemented in the WinISI II software (Infrasoft International LLC, State College, PA). Prediction accuracy was estimated for each trait and model using 25 replicates of a training-testing validation procedure.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

The wet models for arabinose, Klason lignin, acid soluble lignin, ash, extractives, rhamnose, acid insoluble residue, and nitrogen tended to have lower R2 values (0.80+) for the validation sets and the wet models for galactose, mannose, and acid insoluble ash were less accurate, only having value for rough sample screening.

Given that most peat accumulates in boreal regions, where low temperatures and water saturation preserve organic matter, the existence of peat in (sub)tropical regions remains enigmatic. Here we examined peat and plant chemistry across a latitudinal transect from the Arctic to the tropics. Near-surface low-latitude peat has lower carbohydrate and greater aromatic content than near-surface high-latitude peat, creating a reduced oxidation state and resulting recalcitrance. This recalcitrance allows peat to persist in the (sub)tropics despite warm temperatures. Because we observed similar declines in carbohydrate content with depth in high-latitude peat, our data explain recent field-scale deep peat warming experiments in which catotelm (deeper) peat remained stable despite temperature increases up to 9\,\textdegree C. We suggest that high-latitude deep peat reservoirs may be stabilized in the face of climate change by their ultimately lower carbohydrate and higher aromatic composition, similar to tropical peats.},

Numerous previous references established both philosophical and computational guidelines for implementing Bayesian methods. However, protocols for incorporating prior information, the defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy, are nearly nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and evolution by providing a `consumer's guide' to weakly informative priors. The first section outlines three reasons why ecologists should abandon noninformative priors: 1) common flat priors are not always noninformative, 2) noninformative priors provide the same result as simpler frequentist methods, and 3) noninformative priors suffer from the same high type I and type M error rates as frequentist methods. The second section provides a guide for implementing informative priors, wherein I detail convenient `reference' prior distributions for common statistical models (i.e. regression, ANOVA, hierarchical models). I then use simulations to visually demonstrate how informative priors influence posterior parameter estimates. With the guidelines provided here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses in ecology. Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of prior information, but should consider weakly informative priors as the new `default' prior for any Bayesian model.},

Here we show that the stoichiometry of peat and porewater, a control of plant growth and decomposition, has been altered in response to long-term N, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilization at Mer Bleue ombrotrophic bog in eastern Ontario, Canada. In Nfertilized peat, receiving up to an additional 6.4 g N m-2 y-1 above ambient deposition, we found N significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) greater, P both significantly greater and smaller dependent on treatment concentration, calcium (Ca) and K concentrations significantly lower, relative to control plots. In NPK-fertilized peat, P was greater than control while Ca was significantly smaller. In the porewater of N- and NPK-fertilized peat, we observed significantly more ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen, phosphate, and dissolved organic phosphorus than in the controls. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis demonstrated that fertilization in all treatments increased decomposition, as indicated by residual enrichment of refractory moieties such as aromatics, carboxylates, and lignin, albeit only in the uppermost depths. Changes in peat quality may, however, not only relate to advanced decomposition but also to changes in litter input, as predominant vascular vegetation in the fertilized plots shared several features in FTIR spectra with samples of uppermost peat layers. Our results demonstrate that the peat in this ombrotrophic bog has responded to long-term fertilization with loss of Sphagnum moss and its filter function, increased shrub cover and enhanced decomposition.},

  abstract = {Peatlands represent important archives of Holocene paleoclimatic information. However, autogenic processes may disconnect peatland hydrological behavior from climate and overwrite climatic signals in peat records. We use a simulation model of peatland development driven by a range of Holocene climate reconstructions to investigate climate signal preservation in peat records. Simulated water-table depths and peat decomposition profiles exhibit homeostatic recovery from prescribed changes in rainfall, whereas changes in temperature cause lasting alterations to peatland structure and function. Autogenic ecohydrological feedbacks provide both high- and low-pass filters for climatic information, particularly rainfall. Large-magnitude climatic changes of an intermediate temporal scale (i.e., multidecadal to centennial) are most readily preserved in our simulated peat records. Simulated decomposition signals are offset from the climatic changes that generate them due to a phenomenon known as secondary decomposition. Our study provides the mechanistic foundations for a framework to separate climatic and autogenic signals in peat records.},

The purpose of this study was to develop near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) calibration models that could predict these characteristics in a large dataset including 300 EOMs representative of the broad range of such materials applied to cultivated soils (plant materials, animal manures, composts, sludges, etc.). The NIRS predictions of total organic matter and total organic carbon were satisfactory (R2P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.80 and 0.85, ratio of performance to deviation, RPDP {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.2 and 2.6, respectively), and prediction of the Van Soest soluble, cellulose and holocellulose fractions were acceptable (R2P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.82, 0.73 and 0.70, RPDP {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.3, 1.9 and 1.8, respectively) with coefficients of variation close to those of the reference methods. The NIRS prediction of carbon mineralization during incubation was satisfactory and indeed better regarding the short-term results of mineralization (R2P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.78 and 0.78, and RPDP {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.1 and 2.0 for 3 and 7 days of incubation, respectively). The IROC indicator was predicted with fairly good accuracy (R2P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.79, RPDP {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.2). Variables related to the long-term C mineralization of EOM in soil were not predicted accurately, except for IROC which was based on analytical and well-identified characteristics, probably because of the increasing interactions and complexity of the factors governing EOM mineralization in soil as a function of incubation time. This study demonstrated the possibility of developing NIRS predictive models for EOM characteristics in heterogeneous datasets of EOMs. However, specific NIRS predictive models still remain necessary for sludges, organo-mineral fertilizers and liquid manures. \'O 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to compare several widely used Bayesian model selection methods in practical model selection problems, highlight their differences and give recommendations about the preferred approaches. We focus on the variable subset selection for regression and classification and perform several numerical experiments using both simulated and real world data. The results show that the optimization of a utility estimate such as the cross-validation (CV) score is liable to finding overfitted models due to relatively high variance in the utility estimates when the data is scarce. This can also lead to substantial selection induced bias and optimism in the performance evaluation for the selected model. From a predictive viewpoint, best results are obtained by accounting for model uncertainty by forming the full encompassing model, such as the Bayesian model averaging solution over the candidate models. If the encompassing model is too complex, it can be robustly simplified by the projection method, in which the information of the full model is projected onto the submodels. This approach is substantially less prone to overfitting than selection based on CV-score. Overall, the projection method appears to outperform also the maximum a posteriori model and the selection of the most probable variables. The study also demonstrates that the model selection can greatly benefit from using crossvalidation outside the searching process both for guiding the model size selection and assessing the predictive performance of the finally selected model.},

First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

We demonstrate that in many cases one can benefit from a decision theoretically justified two-stage approach: first, construct a possibly non-sparse model that predicts well, and then find a minimal subset of features that characterize the predictions. The model built in the first step is referred to as the reference model and the operation during the latter step as predictive projection. The key characteristic of this approach is that it finds an excellent tradeoff between sparsity and predictive accuracy, and the gain comes from utilizing all available information including prior and that coming from the left out features. We review several methods that follow this principle and provide novel methodological contributions. We present a new projection technique that unifies two existing techniques and is both accurate and fast to compute. We also propose a way of evaluating the feature selection process using fast leave-one-out cross-validation that allows for easy and intuitive model size selection. Furthermore, we prove a theorem that helps to understand the conditions under which the projective approach could be beneficial.

However, based on a review of the literature it seems to be no consensus on which variable (predicted or observed) should be placed in each axis. Although some researchers think that it is identical, probably because r2 is the same for both regressions, the intercept and the slope of each regression differ and, in turn, may change the result of the model evaluation. We present mathematical evidence showing that the regression of predicted (in the y-axis) vs. observed data (in the x-axis) (PO) to evaluate models is incorrect and should lead to an erroneous estimate of the slope and intercept. In other words, a spurious effect is added to the regression parameters when regressing PO values and comparing them against the 1:1 line. Observed (in the y-axis) vs. predicted (in the x-axis) (OP) regressions should be used instead. We also show in an example from the literature that both approaches produce significantly different results that may change the conclusions of the model evaluation.},

  abstract = {We identified the effects of vegetation changes, and aerobic and anaerobic decay on the lignin composition in the Penido Vello peat record (Galicia, Spain). The ombrotrophic part of this peat record was dominated by graminoids and has significant contributions of ericoids at some depths. The organic matter (OM) of different peat fractions (bulk, NaOH-extractable fraction, and non-extractable residues) of 15 samples from the upper meter was analysed with pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (pyrolysis-GC/MS). In addition, the dominant plant species were analysed, including Carex durieui, Agrostis curtisii, Molinia caerulea, Deschampsia flexuosa, Festuca rubra, Eriophorum angustifolium, Erica mackaiana and Calluna vulgaris, and their lignin composition compared to that of the peat OM. The high abundance of guaiacol and 4-formylguaiacol in fresh plant tissue compared to peat OM suggests that in addition to p-coumaric and ferulic acid (which are abundant in graminoids), other non-lignin phenolic monomers are contributed by graminoid species. For the non-lignin phenolics, graminoids differed from ericoids in the high abundance of ferulic acid (4-vinylguaiacol), while p-coumaric acid (4-vinylphenol) showed high and similar abundances in ericoids and graminoids. This result suggests that ratios between p-hydroxyphenyl (or p-coumaric acid) and other lignin moieties in (pyrolysates of) peat cannot be used as source indicator. Comparison of plant and peat fractions using factor analysis allowed a distinction between the effects of source (plant identity) and decay on the lignin composition of the Penido Vello peat, and different stages of decomposition were identified. Preferential decay of guaiacyl over syringyl moieties was found for the first stage of decay. This preferential decay is probably related to the large abundance of guaiacyl moieties in easily degradable non-lignin phenolics. Preferential decay of syringyl moieties occurred during subsequent aerobic decay.},

All three hypotheses were rejected by the data. We then proposed a new hypothesis, in which rapid decomposition of the labile (water-soluble) fraction stimulates the decomposition of lignin by white-rot fungi and the decomposition of hemicellulose by brown-rot fungi. A more rapid decomposition of hemicellulose then stimulates the decomposition of cellulose. This hypothesis is both consistent with known biology and with our data and is proposed as the most viable current hypothesis.},

On the other hand, the virgin humic peat profile exhibited random variations in the content of the individual amino acids and in the amount of amino acid N. Of the other peats examined, the fibric sphagnum had the highest percentage of amino acid N. Among the separates, the 100- to 200-mesh material had the highest proportion of amino acid N. The amino acid composition of the plant remains from the peat was similar to that of the peat from which it was isolated. The amino acid composition of the Typha and Carex plants was different from that of peat in that 75\% of their total N content could be accounted for on the basis of amino acid, amide and amino sugar N. The amounts of hydroxyproline and the amino sugars in peats vary more than that of the amino compounds. In contrast to inorganic soils, which tend to have a similar amino acid composition, these limited data suggest that the amino acid and amino sugar contents of peats may be characteristic of individual bogs.},

Rapid assessment of the chemical properties of N. affinis is necessary for both bamboo breeding and industrial utilization. This study was performed to investigate the abilities of Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy in the diffuse reflectance mode (FT-NIR-DR) and Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance (FT-IR-ATR) spectroscopy to predict the contents of holocellulose, a-cellulose, Klason lignin, and NaOH extractives in N. affinis. Partial least squares regression models based on the raw and preprocessed spectra, including multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) and Savitzky-Golay 1st and 2nd derivative spectra, were developed for the chemical components of bamboo. The NIR-based calibrations displayed better performance than those using FT-IR-ATR spectra. The best calibrations developed by both methods for properties all had satisfactory correlations, with coefficient of determination (R2c) values ranging from 0.81 (Klason lignin by FT-IR and MSC) to 0.98 (a-cellulose by FT-NIR and 2nd derivative), and root mean standard error of calibration between 0.50 and 1.47\%.

To the authors' knowledge it is the first time that carbonate was quantified in soil samples by FT-IR spectroscopy. The carbonate contents of the test soils ranged from 11.3 to 13.1\%. Both methods gave similar results, however, results obtained from FT-IR spectra depend on the spectral band used for the carbonate determination. In our investigation we used the bands at 875 and 2506 cm-1. In case of the band at 2506 cm-1 the difference between FT-IR and Scheibler method was a factor of 1.56, in case of 875 cm-1 the respective factor was 1.16. It can be concluded that FT-IR with both bands has a potential to be used in practice as substitution of the Scheibler method. The advantages of the FT-IR method are better reproducibility and the simultaneous characterization of soil organic matter in bulk samples. The disadvantage is its higher cost.},

  abstract = {Abstract. To understand global soil organic matter (SOM) chemistry and its dynamics, we need tools to efficiently quantify SOM properties, for example prediction models using mid infrared spectra. However, the advantages of such models rely on their validity and accuracy. Recently, Hodgkins et al. (2018) developed models to quantitatively predict organic matter holocellulose and Klason lignin contents, two indicators of SOM stability and major fractions of organic matter. The models may have the potential to understand large-scale SOM gradients and have been used in various studies. A research gap to fill is that these models have not been validated in detail yet. What are their limitations and how can we improve them? This study provides a validation with the aim to identify concrete steps to improve these models. As a first step, we provide several improvements using the original training data. The major limitation we identified is that the original training data are not representative for a range of diverse peat samples. This causes both biased estimates and extrapolation uncertainty under the original models. In addition, the original models can in practice produce unrealistic predictions (negative values or values {$>$}100 mass-\%). Our improved models partly reduce the observed bias, have a better predictive performance for the training data, and avoid such unrealistic predictions. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept that holocellulose contents can also be predicted for mineral-rich samples. A key step to improve the models will be to collect training data that is representative for SOM formed under various conditions. This study opens directions to develop operational models to predict SOM holocellulose and Klason lignin contents from mid infrared spectra.}

FT IR determined that peat humification increased rapidly between 30 and 75 cm, indicating a highly reactive intermediate-depth zone consistent with changes in C:N ratio, {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N, bulk density, and water content. Peat decomposition at the MEF, especially in the intermediate-depth zone, is mainly characterized by preferential utilization of O-alkyl-C, carboxyl-C, and other oxygenated functionalities with a concomitant increase in the abundance of alkyl- and nitrogen-containing compounds. Below 75 cm, less change was observed but aromatic functionalities and lignin accumulated with depth. Significant correlations with humification indices, identified by FT IR spectroscopy, were found for C:N ratios. Incubation studies at 22\textdegree C revealed the highest methane production rates, greatest CH4:CO2 production ratios, and significant O-alkyl-C utilization within this 30 and 75 cm zone. Oxygen-containing functionalities, especially O-alkyl-C, appear to serve as excellent proxies for soil decomposition rate and should be a sensitive indicator of the response of the solid phase peat to increased temperatures caused by climate change and the field study manipulations that are planned to occur at this site. Radiocarbon signatures of microbial respiration products in deeper pore waters at the MEF resembled the signatures of more modern dissolved organic carbon rather than solid phase peat, indicating that recently photosynthesized organic matter fueled the bulk of subsurface microbial respiration. These results indicate that carbon cycling at depth at the MEF is not isolated from surface processes.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

  abstract = {Peatlands contain a significant fraction of global soil carbon, but how these reservoirs will respond to the changing climate is still relatively unknown. A global picture of the variations in peat organic matter chemistry will aid our ability to gauge peatland soil response to climate. The goal of this research is to test the hypotheses that 1) peat carbohydrate content, an indicator of soil organic matter reactivity, will increase with latitude and decrease with mean annual temperatures (MAT), 2) while peat aromatic content, an indicator of recalcitrance, will vary inversely, and 3) elevation will have a similar effect to latitude. We used Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to examine variations in the organic matter functional groups of 1034 peat samples collected from 10-20, 30-40, and 60-70 cm depths at 165 individual sites across a latitudinal gradient of 79\r{}N to 65\r{}S and from elevations of 0 to 4773 meters. Carbohydrate contents of high latitude peat were significantly greater than peat originating near the equator, while aromatic content showed the opposite trend. For peat from similar latitudes but different elevations, the carbohydrate content was greater and aromatic content was lower at higher elevations. Higher carbohydrate content at higher latitudes indicates a greater potential for mineralization, whereas the chemical composition of low latitude peat is consistent with their apparent relative stability in the face of warmer temperatures. The combination of low carbohydrates and high aromatics at warmer locations near the equator suggests the mineralization of high latitude peat until reaching recalcitrance under a new temperature regime.},

  abstract = {Temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition may have a significant impact on global warming. Enzyme-kinetic hypothesis suggests that decomposition of low-quality substrate (recalcitrant molecular structure) requires higher activation energy and thus has greater temperature sensitivity than that of high-quality, labile substrate. Supporting evidence, however, relies largely on indirect indices of substrate quality. Furthermore, the enzyme-substrate reactions that drive decomposition may be regulated by microbial physiology and/or constrained by protective effects of soil mineral matrix. We thus tested the kinetic hypothesis by directly assessing the carbon molecular structure of low-density fraction (LF) which represents readily accessible, mineral-free SOM pool. Using five mineral soil samples of contrasting SOM concentrations, we conducted 30-days incubations (15, 25, and 35 \textdegree C) to measure microbial respiration and quantified easily soluble C as well as microbial biomass C pools before and after the incubations. Carbon structure of LFs ({$<$}1.6 and 1.6\textendash 1.8 g cm\`A3) and bulk soil was measured by solid-state 13C-NMR. Decomposition Q10 was significantly correlated with the abundance of aromatic plus alkyl-C relative to O-alkyl-C groups in LFs but not in bulk soil fraction or with the indirect C quality indices based on microbial respiration or biomass. The warming did not significantly change the concentration of biomass C or the three types of soluble C despite two- to three-fold increase in respiration. Thus, enhanced microbial maintenance respiration (reduced C-use efficiency) especially in the soils rich in recalcitrant LF might lead to the apparent equilibrium between SOM solubilization and microbial C uptake. Our results showed physical fractionation coupled with direct assessment of molecular structure as an effective approach and supported the enzyme-kinetic interpretation of widely observed C quality-temperature relationship for short-term decomposition. Factors controlling long-term decomposition Q10 are more complex due to protective effect of mineral matrix and thus remain as a central question.},

  abstract = {Alkaline cupric oxide oxidation and proximate analysis were used to investigate the sources and diagenetic state of organic matter in six Sphagnum-dominated peatlands located between Alberta, Canada, and Ohio, U.S.A. Cupric oxide oxidation was also used to characterize vascular and nonvascular wetland plant species to provide a specific biological fingerprint of these plant tissues. Oxidation of 15 species of Sphagnum moss released large quantities of unsubstituted p-hydroxyl phenolic compounds as well as the species specific sphagnum acid (p-hydroxy-{$\beta$}-[carboxymethyl]-cinnamic acid). By contrast, vascular plant tissues released large amounts of lignin oxidation products. Cupric oxide oxidation of Sphagnum peat from more northerly sites produced mainly p-hydroxyl phenolic monomers with lesser amounts of vascular lignin derived phenols. In contrast, southern sites and those dominated by woody vegetation produced oxidation products characteristic of vascular plant lignin. A distinct relationship exists between the amount of acid-insoluble Klason lignin and both the diagenetically sensitive phenolic acid to aldehyde ratios as well as the total yield of vanillyl phenolic oxidation products. We found evidence of selective decay of phenolic lignin precursors. These relationships indicate the lignin component in surficial layers of Sphagnum-dominated peat is influenced by both Sphagnum and vascular plant lignin, and the structure of lignin appears to undergo diagenetic changes in these layers. Application of an end-member mixing model revealed that lignin oxidation products poorly predicted vegetational composition of the lignin in more decomposed peat, probably as a result of selective decay of lignin structural phenols.},

  abstract = {Calibration transfer for use with spectroscopic instruments, particularly for near-infrared, infrared, and Raman analysis, has been the subject of multiple articles, research papers, book chapters, and technical reviews. There has been a myriad of approaches published and claims made for resolving the problems associated with transferring calibrations; however, the capability of attaining identical results over time from two or more instruments using an identical calibration still eludes technologists. Calibration transfer, in a precise definition, refers to a series of analytical approaches or chemometric techniques used to attempt to apply a single spectral database, and the calibration model developed using that database, for two or more instruments, with statistically retained accuracy and precision. Ideally, one would develop a single calibration for any particular application, and move it indiscriminately across instruments and achieve identical analysis or prediction results. There are many technical aspects involved in such precision calibration transfer, related to the measuring instrument reproducibility and repeatability, the reference chemical values used for the calibration, the multivariate mathematics used for calibration, and sample presentation repeatability and reproducibility. Ideally, a multivariate model developed on a single instrument would provide a statistically identical analysis when used on other instruments following transfer. This paper reviews common calibration transfer techniques, mostly related to instrument differences, and the mathematics of the uncertainty between instruments when making spectroscopic measurements of identical samples. It does not specifically address calibration maintenance or reference laboratory differences.},

  abstract = {This study used thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to study the transit of organic C through a peatland ecosystem. The biomass, litter, peat soil profile, particulate organic matter (POM), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluxes were sampled from the Moor House National Nature Reserve, a peat-covered catchment in northern England where both the dry matter and carbon budget for the catchment were known. The study showed that although TGA traces showed distinct differences between organic matter reservoirs and fluxes, the traces could not readily be associated with particular functionalities or elemental properties. The TGA trace shows that polysaccharides are preferentially removed by humification and degradation with residual peat being dominated by lignin compositions. The DOM is derived from the degradation of lignin while the POM is derived from erosion of the peat profile. The carbon lost as gases (CO2 and CH4) was estimated to be composed of 92 to 95\% polysaccharide carbon. The composition of the organic matter lost from the peat ecosystem means that the oxidative ratio (OR) of the ecosystem experienced by the atmosphere was between 0.96 and 0.99: currently, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change uses an OR value of 1.1 for all ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has increasingly been adopted as an analytical tool in various fields, such as the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, environmental, clinical, agricultural, food and biomedical sectors during the past 15 years. A NIR spectrum of a sample is typically measured by modern scanning instruments at hundreds of equally spaced wavelengths. The large number of spectral variables in most data sets encountered in NIR spectral chemometrics often renders the prediction of a dependent variable unreliable. Recently, considerable effort has been directed towards developing and evaluating different procedures that objectively identify variables which contribute useful information and/or eliminate variables containing mostly noise. This review focuses on the variable selection methods in NIR spectroscopy. Selection methods include some classical approaches, such as manual approach (knowledge based selection), ``Univariate'' and ``Sequential'' selection methods; sophisticated methods such as successive projections algorithm (SPA) and uninformative variable elimination (UVE), elaborate search-based strategies such as simulated annealing (SA), artificial neural networks (ANN) and genetic algorithms (GAs) and interval base algorithms such as interval partial least squares (iPLS), windows PLS and iterative PLS. Wavelength selection with B-spline, Kalman filtering, Fisher's weights and Bayesian are also mentioned. Finally, the websites of some variable selection software and toolboxes for non-commercial use are given.},

  abstract = {Rates of organic carbon mineralization (to CO2 and CH4) vary widely in peat soil. We transplanted four peat soils with different chemical composition into six sites with different environmental conditions to help resolve the debate about control of organic carbon mineralization by resource availability (e.g. carbon and nutrient chemistry) versus environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, moisture, pH). The four peat soils were derived from Sphagnum (bog moss). Two transplant sites were in mid-boreal Alberta, Canada, two were in low-boreal Ontario, Canada, and two were in the temperate United States. After 3 years in the field, CH4 production varied significantly as a function of peat type, transplant site, and the type\textendash site interaction. All four peat soils had very small rates of CH4 production ({$<$} 20 nmol g\`A1 day\`A1) after transplant into two sites, presumably caused by acid site conditions (pH {$<$} 4.0). One peat soil had small CH4 production rates regardless of transplant site. A canonical discriminant analysis revealed that large rates of CH4 production (4000 nmol g\`A1 day\`A1) correlated with large holocellulose content, a large concentration of p-hydroxyl phenolic compounds in the Klason lignin, and small concentrations of N, Ca and Mn in peat. Significant variation in rates of CO2 production correlated positively with holocellulose content and negatively with N concentrations, regardless of transplant site. The temperature response for CO2 production varied as a function of climate, being greater for peat formed in a cold climate, but did not apply to transplanted peat. Although we succeeded in elucidating some aspects of peat chemistry controlling production of CH4 and CO2 in Sphagnum-derived peat soils, we also revealed idiosyncratic combinations of peat chemistry and site conditions that will complicate forecasting rates of peat carbon mineralization into the future.},
